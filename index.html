        		<p>Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. We'll have to find something to do so that people can look at you without wanting to kill themselves. Even though sooooo many people in this office are begging for it. I am having a love affair with this ice cream sandwich. I'll be in the hospital bar. You know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother. Well, this is why people hate hospitals. Taste the happy, Michael. Taste it. It tastes kind of like sad. I know she's a brownish area! With points! And I love her!</p>
        		<p>I'm tired of trying to find happiness through lies and self-medicating. If you need me, I'll be at the bar. And I wouldn't just lie there, if that's what you're thinking. That's not what I WAS thinking. It's one banana Michael, what could it cost, ten dollars? Michael, I'm your older brother. I'll never be proud of you. She's not that Mexican, Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Columbian or something. Turn this skiff around!</p>
